# **Upscalers**

### It is currently open to discussion whether all these different **upscalers** should be only usable on their respective standalone tabs.

### _**Why?**_

* When you generate a large batch of images, will every image be good enough to deserve upscaling? 
* Images are upscaled after generation, this delays the generation of the next image in the batch, it's better to wait for the batch to finish then decide whether the image needs upscaling
* Clutter: more upscalers = more gui options

### What if I _need_ upscaling after generation and can't just do it as post-processing?

* One solution would be to hide the options by default, and have a cli switch to enable them
* One issue with the above solution is needing to still maintain gui options for all new upscalers
* Another issue is how to ensure people who need it know about it without people who don't need it accidentally activating it then getting unexpected results?

### Which upscalers are planned?

* **goBIG**: this was implemented but reverted due to a bug and then the decision was made to wait until other upscalers were added to reimplement
* **SwinIR-L 4x**
* **CodeFormer**
* _**more, suggestions welcome**_
* if the idea of keeping all upscalers as post-processing is accepted then a single **'Upscalers'** tab with all upscalers could simplify the process and the UI
