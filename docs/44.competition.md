# Textual inversion usage competition

We are hosting a competition where the community can showcase their most inventive use of textual inversion concepts in text-to-image or text-to-video.

Our compute cluster; `Nataili`, currently comprises of 3 nodes, two have 3090, the other has 2 x A5000.

We estimate `Nataili` can handle 12 concepts per hour, and we can add more workers if there is high demand.

Hopefully demand will be high, we want to train **hundreds** of new concepts!

# Schedule

2022/10/20 - Competition announced, training begins
2022/10/22 12AM UTC - Stage 2 begins, text to image command opened for usage
2022/10/22 12PM UTC - Stage 1 ends

# How do I train a concept using the discord bot?

Type `/trainconcept` then press tab to go through the fields

`Concept name` is just a name for your concept, it doesn't have to be a single word

`Placeholder` is what you will use in prompts to represent your concept
Add `<` and `>` so it is unique, multiple words should be hyphenated

`Initializer` is used as the starting point for training your concept, so this should be a single word that represents your concept

Minimum 2 images. Squareish aspect ratios work best

# How do I use the trained concept?

## Prompting with concepts

When your concept is trained you can use it in prompts.

`a cute <nvidiafu> as an astronaut`:

or `a green <green-couch> sitting on top of a floor, a 3D render, trending on polycount, minimalism, rendered in cinema4d`:

## Using concepts in the webui

The discord bot will give you a link to a `.zip` file, download this, extract it, and put the folder in `stable-diffusion-webui/models/custom/sd-concepts-library`
