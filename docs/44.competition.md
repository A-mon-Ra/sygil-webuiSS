# How do I train a concept using the discord bot?

Type `/trainconcept` then press tab to go through the fields

`Concept name` is just a name for your concept, it doesn't have to be a single word

`Placeholder` is what you will use in prompts to represent your concept
Add `<` and `>` so it is unique, multiple words should be hyphenated

`Initializer` is used as the starting point for training your concept, so this should be a single word that represents your concept

Minimum 2 images. Squareish aspect ratios work best

# How do I use the trained concept?

## Prompting with concepts

When your concept is trained you can use it in prompts.

`a cute <nvidiafu> as an astronaut`:

or `a green <green-couch> sitting on top of a floor, a 3D render, trending on polycount, minimalism, rendered in cinema4d`:

## Using concepts in the webui

The discord bot will give you a link to a `.zip` file, download this, extract it, and put the folder in `stable-diffusion-webui/models/custom/sd-concepts-library`
